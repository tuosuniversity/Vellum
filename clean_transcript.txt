okay what's up what's unpack this have you ever felt like you're stuck in stuck in the same old thought patterns or maybe that feeling when even with well-meaning advice especially safe in a group setting it just doesn't quite fit your unique situation it's really common experience isn't it we often get to sort of General guidance but our inner world will see anything but General it's complex it's this intricate deeply personal landscape So today we're embarking the deep diver going into some truly Innovative concept think the problem is not just new methods of actually a fundamentally different way to approach her in a world things that could really count as your personal growth seems like a pretty revolutionary approach to personal transformation in mindfulness it's designed to be deeply personal yet and that's the interesting part remarkably scalable a large groups imagine a framework called Quantum Mind practice it introduces his powerful concept that template it allows for intense individualized Focus but within  Collective setting I know at first glance that might sound a bit like a paradox right how can something be both universally applicable and profoundly personal at the same time but Evelyn sport today it's actually quite an elegant solution eye drops you entirely new methods and ideas for working with your Consciousness that's exactly the mission of this deep dive we're really here to extract those unique nuggets of Knowledge from our sources the aim is to inspire you The Listener with these fresh perspective and crucially actionable ideas for your own personal transformation will explore this framework enable split called active intervention in shaping your reality which you know moves well beyond just passive observation which is often where many traditional mindfulness practice is 10 to stop and importantly we'll see how this approach masterfully avoids those common pitfalls of generalized strategies you know the ones the ones that off and leave people feeling on her door and seen or maybe like their specific challenges are really being addressed our aim is for you to walk away.  Understanding what these ideas are but truly grasping why they matter and how they could offer some really profound A-ha moments may be shifting your entire approach to your inner work good idea who's actually quite fascinating it didn't come from a traditional therapy background initially it actually began with a thought process that might surprise you was like a software developer brainstorming a new app the initial thought and this is Straight From the Source material was  I was thinking like a developer to create a template that even in a group one could take their target into a group session so Corey Novation here the real breakthrough is this concept of a mental Talisman where you could call it a variable in a picture for you just for a moment and let's say I don't know in 8 a.m. Quantum mindfulness group session at equinox or the instructor is there guiding everyone through Universal process only that applies to everybody in the room but here's the twist instead of everyone focusing on the same generic idea Like Liquor was stress or find peace each person brings their own internal thing you could be a specific challenges are facing right now maybe a deeply personal goals are striving for a recurring emotional pattern or desired outcome they want to manifest and they hold this is their private mental Talisman throughout the entire sections there's a loan the session itself is Tim platek meeting the process of working with Consciousness the steps you take  is universal for the content with you're actually working on his deeply uniquely personal everyone is running the same piece of software the same application but each person influence their own unique data set and what's truly groundbreaking about this template approach is precisely why it's so brilliant especially for scaling something is profound and potentially complex as Quantum mindfulness it manages to scale it while simultaneously retaining that inherently personal and very importantly active nature let's not let's break down its effectiveness of it first thing about scalability and accessibility this is a genuine game-changer this template allows for a radical personalization within a group each participant engages with the practice in a way that is immediately intimately relevant to their own internal State their own specific challenges or their own goals this immediately cuts through that common feeling you get with a one-size-fits-all approach and approach that let's be honest often false flag group settings precisely because  individual nuance and this naturally leads to broader appeal because your target or mental Talisman that thing you're working on is kept entirely private this means the practice can cater to an incredibly diverse range of individuals it doesn't matter what their specific belief systems are their backgrounds or even their spiritual or religious leanings this is absolutely crucial I think for minimizing any kind of unintentional religious label it allows the practice to be accessible to really wide audience while in this is Keith still leveraging incredibly powerful underlying mechanisms our sources suggest these are often kabbalistic and four principles but they're distilled and applied in the secular very modern framework and from an instructor's point of view it offers highly efficient instruction the guides need to know every single person's specific Target they don't need to delve into everyone's personal narrative instead they guide the universal process of Engagement the internal operations of Consciousness if you like which applies seamlessly regardless of the unique content  is working with s and this is where it gets really fasting this concept aligns perfectly with the fundamental Quantum mindfulness principles it fully and bodies as core concept of active intervention you as the individual practitioner or not just a passive Observer you know simply watching your thoughts or Sensations Float by like clouds No instead you're actively choosing defining and working directly with your chosen Target or mental Talisman this shift the entire Paradigm it moves from passive observation towards actively shaping your inner world this deep personal choice represents what the framework calls conscious agency specifically it engages what's known as a psycho Felician all Dimension you can think of this Dimension as your fundamental in her yes York or will power it embodies our unified awareness and your Primal will it serves as the organizing principle for your entire being actively dissolves perceived limitations and governs how your deepest intentions are formed furthermore within this framework each person is actively working towards  Pacific collapse collapse of their chosen mental superposition into a desired actualized experience be all potential versions exist at once the template died the precise step by step process for your personal collapse turning that pure possibility into your experience reality and it offers remarkable flexibility with a mental quanta in this ontology mental Ponte are defined as the fundamental units of cognitive or experiential possibility are the building blocks that make up the state of cognitive superposition tell so your mental Talisman can be seen as like bundling or representing a specific set of these mental quanta the precise aspects of your inner world that you wish to influence or shift or transform it's a very granular approach it incredibly expensive to doing in her work that makes so much sense wow like we're not to Spectators watching the movie of our thoughts but we're actually the architect's design of the inner landscape  to really make this concrete maybe let's walk through an illustrative example how might a template it session actually feel how it work imagine instructor guiding you through a series of internal stages all will you hold your unique metal Talisman firmly in mind this is where the inspiration for genuinely new methods really starts to take hold I think okay so the session my begin with phase one defining the Target or Talisman instructor wouldn't ask you to share your problem out loud instead they'd guy participants was afraid something like this bring to mind the specific internal State Challenge or desired outcome you wish to work with today give it a middle name or perhaps an image of symbol that represents it for you alone this is your mental Talisman for our practice and this initial step is more than just picking a topic it actively engages with the framework calls the psycho consumptive Dimension this connection is all about ideation that spark of Novel insight and the profound generation of personal meaning you're literally co-creating the concept the mental object that you'll be  then maybe move into phase two unbinding fix perceptions hear the instruction would be to focus your conscious attention on any limiting beliefs or perhaps perceived boundary do you associate with your Talisman you be guided me beat to imagine them dissolve it returning to a state of pure potential just letting them loosen their grip this incredibly powerful move it leverages was described as the inherent an islet of property of your psycho volitional to mention that pure force of will we mentioned it's about consciously on creating or unbinding or dissolving what no longer serves you actively releasing those mental limitations to keep you feeling stuck okay then maybe face three activating you decide to mention here of the guidance might be to identify an inter quality or perhaps an energetic archetype that would best serve your Calvin's transformation silver if your Talisman is a feeling of inadequacy you might consciously choose to activate the quality of confidence or maybe self-acceptance you then be guided to say inhale its essence  activating and resonating with in you this link directly to its described as severe a specific shape to admit we're Schaefer refers to a flow of subtle maybe even Divine energy and the psychodynamic Dimensions themselves those fundamental building blocks of our Consciousness related to qualities like compassion strength and resilience wisdom and so on your consciously drawing in the specific energies you need then face for inner core resourcing this would involve connecting to your deepest inner core that place of pure potential your fundamental self your source of authentic strength and wisdom that's always there you been allowed with pure foundational energy to infuse and perhaps purify your Talisman reorganizing any underlying patterns that no longer serve your highest self this cross on the practice of inner core activation integrating our most fundamental self with your specific intention for the session is really about bringing your entire being into alignment and finally lets a phase 5 intention for manifestation  here you would send a clear conscious intention for how this transform Talisman will manifest in your experience reality how will it show up in your life this step reinforces the understanding that your conscience observation and your intention or not passive acts the actively shape the outcome this connects directly to its called a psycho transpersonal Dimension which serves as the interface between your inner work in your manifest our reality realm of concrete action and experience of the physical world is veld bridging that Gap bring your inner transformation into your actual outer life put your personal journey is incredibly sophisticated it's really quite profound it's far from some superficial self-help technique it directly addresses and I can quite elegantly solve many of the inherent challenges involved in delivering Advanced mindfulness practices in a way that's scalable yet remains deeply secular it ensures profound depth in personal relevance for each individual without ever and posing Dogma or requiring adherence to say  it truly is a remarkably strong concept and one that offers tangible inspiration I think for anyone see can genuinely new methods of personal growth and self-discovery the source material is about the profound impact of language difficulty language in a group setting the key idea here is that the language used needs to be well none triggering neutral and empowering the intuition buying this is to meticulously avoid directly labeling potentially negative experiences think about it for a second if an instructor says something like it doesn't matter if you argue with your spouse this morning we're going to angry with your co-worker maybe trying to be inclusive while the intention might be genuinely well-meaning you can inadvertently caused them in the group to think o wait you've talked about me I did argue with my spouse and now I feel bad or I am angry I my supposed to be  those Pacific labels even use generally can carry this subconscious weight of Judgment of Shame even went absolutely none is intended by the speaker it's a subtle trap is neutral terms like variables or calasanz as practitioner known terms for their personal focus is such an excellent and frankly potent strategy it masterfully maintains privacy it significantly reduces any possibility of judgement either external or internal and most importantly it Fosters deep internal and active engagement the core idea really is to create a kind of code word or conceptual container a neutral Place holder that allows the individual to hold their specific internal experience our goal without ever having to articulate or categorize it externally just completely avoid any potential misinterpretation or Miss labeling or judgment from others or even sometimes crucially from the individual themselves about their own experience let's really unpacked the specific practical benefits of using these mutual terms it's worth welding  first and this is profoundly important in any group work is privacy each person's unique Focus their Thing Remains entirely their own they know precisely what their mental Talisman represents for them but no one else needs to this eliminates that immense pressure people often feel to disclose potentially sensitive or vulnerable or maybe even embarrassing content which is let's face it a huge barrier for many individuals and traditional group setting second there's a powerful sense of neutrality terms like variable or Talisman are inherently neutral they don't carry any pre-assigned positive or negative baggage they are essentially empty vessels waiting for the individual to pour their own meaning into them this allows for a pure unconditioned starting point for the work 3rd and perhaps most empowering is the active participation this Fosters the very Act of choosing their variable or Talisman and then actively working with it throughout the practice will that fundamentally empowers the practitioner it reframes their inner experience no longer something there passively subjected to the Sun  can actively influence something may have agency over and finally a very cleanly maintains a focus on the process This brilliant linguistic Choice shifts the group's Collective attention to the universal process of quantum mindfulness itself the how rather than getting bogged down in the potentially infinite distracting individual contents the what of personal experiences the instructor guides the manipulation of universal psychodynamic Dimensions within each individual regardless of what specific problem or desire the variable happens to represent for each person in the room by creating a safe internal laboratory for your mind  or you can work without anyone looking over your shoulder not even yourself in the judgmental way  to really highlight this distinction to show you these new methods and action let's maybe contrast Howard templated session might guide with this neutral language vs. what you might hear in more traditional settings so instead of giving those explicit concrete examples when introducing the target which is we just discussed can inadvertently lead to that exclusion by example in the structure using this qm approach might open the session by saying something more like this today bring to mind your personal variable that specific internal State Challenge or desired outcome you chosen to work with it could be a specific emotion perhaps thought pattern a personal goal or maybe a dynamic in a relationship just hold it gently privately in your awareness or do you see the other term identify your mental Talisman for this session this is an internal symbol maybe an image or even just a simple phrase that uniquely represents the focus of your practice today another really beautiful alternative could be we are each working with our unique Quantum of focus whatever is that  your conscious compassion detention today General that language is how expansive early inclusive every single person listening can find themselves in those words no matter what they're bringing then when guiding that powerful unbinding fix perception phase instead of saying something potentially loaded like release your anger or let go of your fear the language would remain much more neutral allowing for Universal application  now bring your attention to any fix perceptions or limiting assumptions related to your variable that is how it might feel stuck perhaps or unchangeable begin to use your intention that pure force of your will to unbind these fixed forms allowing them to return to a state of pure potentiality maybe like ice melting back into water or another way to phrase it observe any boundaries or constricting Frameworks around your mental Talisman Mansion dissolving these perceived limitations creating spaciousness for new possibilities to emerge almost as if you're opening up a vast in a room for the energetic archetype of tournament phase were consciously drawing and quality instruction could be something like consider which Universal quality or energetic archetype with most serve your chosen variable or Talisman right now  is it Clarity compassion strength resilience perhaps a sense of peace or boundless creativity call in that Pure Energy feeling it activate aniline within your own unique want them almost like tuning in to a specific radio frequency or perhaps as you breathe imagine drawing in the pure essence of that shows and quality allowing it to vitalize the specific dimensions connected to your internal Focus infusing your Talisman with new life and possibility guiding inner core activation would use phrases that resonate with at Universal Inner Strength we all possess I love this foundational energy to infuse purify your variable or Talisman reorganizing any underlying patterns that no longer serve your highest self like performing a deep energetic cleanse  and if you're chose a variable happen to involve a relationship Dynamic the guidance were interconnected residents would be carefully neutral and Boundary aware if your variable involves a relationship bring that Dynamic gently into your awareness without judgment use your refined perception to discern what is truly yours in that Dynamic what belongs to the other person and what is the interconnected residence between you that shared energetic space then perhaps it clear compassionate boundaries around your own energetic space allowing for both connection and healthy distinction powerful precisely because it allows for what the framework describes as radical personalization everyone in the group is doing their specific work on their unique issue which dramatically increases engagement relevance and ultimately the effectiveness of the practice for each person it also cultivate the profound psychological safety no one feels expose we're judged or misunderstood because of their internal content remains private  the focus is on the universal human capacity to actively engage with inner experience it promotes consistent active engagement because participants aren't just passively listening to a generic talk or following vague instructions they are actively performing specific internal operations on their chosen variables are talismans are doing something internally and finally it ensures conceptual consistency it directly leverages the quantum mindfulness ontologist powerful Concepts like psychodynamic Dimensions cognitive superposition and actualized experience without necessarily needing to use the highly technical jargon overtly in a general class setting it's quite elegant in its Simplicity yet absolutely profound and its potential transformative effect it truly offer than you and I think deeply inspiring method for self-discovery and growth hashtag taitague mitigating exclusion by example and non slow version that distinction is so critical and it leads us directly to another really significant problem that this template based approach brilliantly sauce do they work  exclusion by example have you ever been in a workshop maybe or group meditation and he's treacherous is something really specific like if you're feeling Anger from a co-worker or if you've argued with your spouse and your specific nuanced issue it just simply isn't mentioned what happens inside you in that moment or what often happens perhaps subconsciously is it you might think my problem isn't like those specific examples he mentioned this practice probably isn't designed for my unique situation then huh and the seemingly small moment of exclusion it can lead to several significant negative outcomes first you might develop a limited scope reception you mistakenly conclude that the practice is inapplicable irrelevant to you second there's a lack of relatability which makes the entire practice feel more abstract and less connected to your immediate lived experience third he can suddenly and completely unintentionally create these hierarchies of what are considered valid or common problems making your unique internal struggle feel somehow less important or less  deserving of attention and forth it actually adds significant cognitive load Universe pending mental energy trying to translate the general instructions which were tied to it a specific example to your specific unmentioned problem that can be distracting frustrating and ultimately reduces the effectiveness of the practice it's a subtle but quite powerful form of alienation actually on this approach with its template and variables directly and intentionally counters those risks by explicitly stating right from the outset today bring to mind your personal variable the framework immediately signaled any issue any internal experience is valid and welcome the very broadest and universality of terms like variable or Talisman confirms that the framework is inherently designed to handle the infinite permutations of Human Experience a sense of universal applicability it all so powerfully and power self-identification it places the responsibility and crucially the agency  squarely on the individual to identify their own thing ensuring intrinsic relevance right from the very first moment there's no need to wait for the instructor to name your issue for example how to unbind fix perceptions while the content remains entirely personal and private this means every single instruction every guided step applies directly and immediately to their toes and focus their by brilliantly maintain individual focused even within a large group setting ultimately the language itself becomes deeply and inherently inclusive it Fosters a profound sense that everyone regardless of their unique internal landscape is engaging in the same fundamental powerful and potentially transformative process it's truly a novel method for facilitating Collective yet intensely personal growth and Exploration Lite regarding this problem of labels touching on what are sources call ontological Precision  you pointed out something really profound for the source material because labels are semantic representation and ontology sadness is understood still vague anger for me is not anger for you had to be in group causes of collective ontology that may fall short wow that's a truly deep observation about the very nature of our inner experience and how we communicate it if we want to understand the power of this approach what's elaborate on this a bit when we use common labels like anger or sadness and everyday language while we generally understand them semantically their specific instantiation of their lives reality they're unique meaning for that person and their precise phenomenological experience varies wildly from person to person it's just not the same thing internally my personal experience of anger might be safe the quiet simmering resentment that hardens my job yours might be an explosive outward Outburst someone else's might be a cold calculated Fury that leads them to withdraw completely the label is the same  but the underlying psychodynamic Dimensions those fundamental energetic and conscious building blocks of our inner world and their specific activation level are entirely unique to each individual in that moment this highlights the inherent vagueness and Paula Smith multiple meetings in our common emotional language the label anger is merely a macro-level descriptor what we're actually working with internally when we use the qm approach is a micro-level multi-dimensional configuration that is utterly unique to each individual  furthermore in Quantum mindfulness we Define a psychological State not as some monolithic singular entity but rather as complex emergent patterns understood as multi-dimensional field collapses involving specific combinations and interactions of underlying psychodynamic Dimensions so an individual's experience of anxiety for example isn't just anxiety as a lump sum category is actually formed by unique Dynamic interaction of each underlined psychodynamic Dimensions within that specific person at that specific time when an instructor consistently uses concrete labeled examples like your anger your inside of your sadness they are implicitly perhaps completely unintentionally attempting to establish a kind of consensus reality for internal States but this consensus simply doesn't hold true at the precise psychodynamic level of individual experience they can't this can lead to what the framework called ontological misalignment where individuals try to force their Rich unique internal experience into a generalized instructor to find label that simply doesn't  capture its truth or complexity it also significantly limits perceptual sophistication and encourages Reliance on these broadcommon labels rather than developing the capacity to discern the intricate contributions of each psychodynamic to mention within a seemingly monolithic feeling the psychodynamic dimensions are in essence the fundamental precise units of our psychic architecture the actual building blocks of our emotions and thoughts using vague labels of skiers this deeper reality even more fascinating and frankly may be a bit unsettling to think about it you've identified a direct subtle and potentially profound call the link here just someone else mentioning anxiety too much can cause one to think this may be anxiety can literally cause anxiety since it Alters the previous take negatively charged with a subtle point that sounds like a crucial one for understanding power in her world is actively formed an influence moment-by-moment it is indeed and this connects directly a family to have psychological  later understood to be formed an influence within the quantum mindfulness ontology instructor or even just a friend or the media repeatedly names a specific psychological State like anxiety that word functions as an external stimulus in qm terms we call this raw sensory data Alpha for someone who's already susceptible to anxiety or perhaps predisposed to it they're mine doesn't register that were neutrally it might rapidly and automatically assign meaning beta to that word and this is signs meaning isn't neutral or objective it's heavily influenced by their past experiences their current internal State and their underlying psychodynamic architecture the meaning of sine could easily become he's talking about my anxiety this applies to me I am anxious as a critical concept refers to the subjective emotional coloring or the numerical rating of positivity or negativity at the mind of science to a specific observation or piece of incoming information think of it as the immediate feeling tone of an observation  valence provides the impact of the now for the cognitive appraisal which is the mines high-level overarching judgment or interpretation of the entire situation including the observation so if you're in the word anxiety particularly if it's generalize or repeated often leads to a negative perceived meaning for that individual then the observation valence automatically becomes negative a significant negative way to their overall cognitive appraisal of moment our ontology also includes Concepts like inertia of the past and prior stayed influence inertia of the past or you could think of it simply as the momentum of old patterns refers to the lingering influence of previous mental and emotional states on the current one so if a person's previous mental state already contained elements anxiety even low-level ones the negative observation balanced experience from hearing the word anxiety discussed will likely amplify this pre-existing inertia of the past this creates a powerful negative feedback loop it reinforces the prior State influence for the  elephant psychodynamic Dimensions involved in anxiety anxiety this might mean a heightened activity in the psycho protective Dimension think of it as the inner alarm system constantly scanning for potential threats becoming hyper-vigilant or perhaps a hypersensitive cycle receptive Dimension and increased sensitivity to settle internal or external to use interpreting them negatively and finally this negatively waited cognitive appraisal directly and Chris's the dimensional activation for these anxiety-related Dimensions this increased activation then actualize has it collapses from potential into reality as some more pronounced more intense overall mental state of anxiety so yes quite literally a person can feel more anxious simply by hearing the word anxiety discussed early if they are susceptible there for the template and variable Talisman approach is not just about fostering inclusivity your privacy though it does that brilliantly it's a direct sophisticated and deplane for and application of the quantum mindfulness ontology itself its purpose is to  actively prevent this kind of maladaptive psychodynamic way of collapse into negative States and conversely to promote positive actualize experience by minimizing - perceived meaning and carefully avoiding the reinforcement of negative inertia of the past it's really about consciously designing a linguistic and conceptual environment than hair only supports positive transformation at the most fundamental level of your being that itself is an inspiring new method for approaching mental well-being groups explanation it really highlights how language isn't just descriptive it could be actively constructive or unfortunately sometimes destructive in shaping our inner World wow okay now let's shift gears slightly down these Quantum mindfulness practices are actually designed to be integrated into our lives the core idea he was incredibly smart I think she went missing presented to something totally separate something that requires you to throw out everything you already know instead it's designed to upgrade or deepen existing mindfulness practices it provides it to me  entry-point almost like a bridge while subtly introducing Quantum mindfulness is unique and Powerful active intervention element this makes these potentially radical new methods feel much more accessible and inspiring right exactly that's the foundational strategy layering Quantum mindfulness principles on to classical mindfulness and practices this means we are absolutely not asking practitioners to abandon the techniques they already know or what they find effective or what they're comfortable with from traditional mindfulness far from it instead we're building upon that existing Foundation we're allowing them to gently but profoundly shift their mental orientation moving from nearly passive observation which is incredibly valuable for cultivating awareness and nonreactive but can sometimes feel limited to after shaping deeper engagement and intentional influence over their inner World it really is like upgrading your operating system without having to learn a completely new computer language from scratch it leverages was already there let's look at some specific white illustrative examples of his  Shuffle augmentation this will really reveal how these new ideas can enhance your existing practice offering inspiration okay first let's augment mindful breathing we can enhance it with something called The Simpson breath of intentional space okay so standard Michael breathing that's usually just focusing on the sensation right in and out noticing the Body Sensations of the breath as it enters and leaves your body You observe its natural rise and fall without judgment it's a passive equanimous observation excellent for grounding yourself in the present moment mindfulness augmentation you begin with that same Foundation of mindful breathing but as you would help you constantly imagine drawing in pure unconditioned potential you might visualize it as Internet spaciousness or boundless possibility or perhaps Universal energy filling you this subtly Leverage is profound Concepts like the kabbalistic idea of eins off which means Infinite Source  and sits on the mystical idea of Define contraction to create space for existence but we presented in a functionally understandable way without needing to delve into the deep religious or esoteric Origins unless desired the function is key then as you exhale you imagine gently Contracting or focusing that vast infinite potential into your specific mental Talisman or variable that you've chosen for your practice this isn't about pushing anything away or forcing something it's about intentionally collapsing that vast potential into a precise point of focus you're directing it towards your chosen intention for manifestation or transformation The quantum mindfulness goal here is to cultivate an active sense of shaping your internal space you're purposefully directing subtle energy in potentiality towards your chosen Focus this offers inspiring new ways to engage even something as simple as your wow okay so it's like you're not just breathing air you're actively breathing purpose and potential into your inner World your empowering your intentions with every single breath cycle  that feels like a really tangible shipped from just observing precisely that's the active component next listen to their augmenting body scan meditation we can transform it into what we call a dimensional body scan right the classic body scan moving attention through the body noticing heat cold tingling tension noticing whatever sensation their present like warm tingling pressure or tension without judgment is primarily about being present with what is building interoceptive awareness getting to know your physical self now in the quantum mindfulness augmentation you perform a traditional body scan moving your attention slowly through the body but as you focus on each area you actively inquire internally which psychodynamic Dimension feel most active or perhaps suppress here or free for instance as you scan your chest area you might ask internally do I feel a sense of expansion or compassion here which might indicate the cycle and Paddock Dimension being a  or perhaps in your shoulders do I feel boundary is being held tightly or tensions dusting the psycho protective Dimension is at play or maybe done your gut what about my second motivational Dimension where does motivation or perhaps energy to manifest physically in my body if you find an area of what the framework call psychological disorder many like chronic tension a persistent emotional block or a feeling of deep contraction you then actively work to unbind it's fixed perception you do this by mentally sending pure expensive Potential from your sick of listening to mention your pure will York or intention to that specific area you hold the intention for that six pattern to return to a state of cognitive superposition that fluid potential where anything is possible before actively relining it with your overall intention for well-being the quantum mindfulness goal here is to develop profound somatic literacy and structural awareness this means you learn to read your body not just as a collection of physical parts and Sensations but as a dynamic living manifestation of deeper  psychodynamic patterns and then crucially you learn to actively influence them it offers entirely new insights into your body mind connection powerful but you're becoming fluent in the subtle energetic language of your own body but it's not just observing paying attention anymore it's understanding why might be there on a much deeper dimensional level and then doing something about it it's just from passive witness to active participant in your somatic experience then there's augmenting mindful walking we can evolve this into a vectorize awareness walk walking to the feet the movement sound sites  being present while moving precisely and classical mindfulness mindful walking is about paying close attention to the physical sensations of walking of the feeling of your feet contacting the ground the movement of your legs and arms the rhythm of your breath and the surrounding sights and sounds all ideally without judgment it's a contemplatively movement a practice and mobile presents for the Quantum of Solace augmentation he start with that same mindful walk being present with the movement but you introduce your mental Talisman your specific goal or intention that you wish to actualized to bring more fully into your reality you done let each step you take become an active cognitive anchoring of this intention into your perceived reality your grounding your intention with each would fall and instead of just passively noticing your surroundings you consciously use your vision your hearing and all your senses to actively seek out elements in the environment that resonate with or actively support your mental Talisman for example if your Talisman is resilience  just leaves or even draw a feeling of strength from the rootedness of large trees or notice the persistent flow of a river around obstacles if your intention is Clarity you might consciously noticed the expansive openness of the sky with a sharp clear quality of the light this transforms the walk from passive observation into an active perceptual framing exercise you're using the external world to reinforce your internal State the quantum mindfulness goal is to cultivate vectorized awareness which means attention that has both intensity and precise directionality actively shaping your experience reality through Focus movement and purposeful perception it's a genuinely new method for manifesting your intentions while simply taking a walk just walking in the world you're walking with a clear intention actively drawing in and affirming would serve your purpose in the world around you it turns the simple everyday activity like walking into an intentional Act of Creation that's inspiring life  finally let's look at augmenting mindful listening we can enhance it into a residence and receptivity practice listening usually just focusing on sounds internal external without getting caught up in them yes in classical mindfulness this typically involves focusing solely on sounds whether they are internal like shots or the body sounds or external like Birdsong traffic conversation observing them without labeling judging or reacting is the practice of passive reception of pure open attention now in the quantum mindfulness augmentation for internal sounds like persistent looping sauce or swirling emotions you applied the principle of unbinding the fix perception  you gently observe judgmental thoughts or limiting internal narratives and actively allow them to diesel if I to lose their hardness to return to a state of potential rather than being fixed beliefs for external correlational sounds especially when listening to another person in conversation you activate your capacity for interconnected residence you learn to listen not just to the literal words being spoken but to discern the subtle emotional quantum entanglement or psychological entanglement that might be present between you and the speaker you're tuning into the unspoken energetic exchange you actively try to identify the underlying psychodynamic Dimensions that might be a play and what the other person is expressing friend since you might ask yourself internally is this person expressing a need for empathy activating their cycle empathic Dimension or perhaps are they expressing a need for Clear boundaries activating their psycho protected to mention the quantum mindfulness goal here is to profoundly enhance your perceptual sophistication communication and to cultivate deeper relational health  you do this by actively engaging with the subtle energetic layers of sound and Communications moving well beyond just the literal meaning to understand the underlying patterns needs and intentions this offer is a deeply inspiring new way to connect more authentically with others and even with your own inner dialogue so by strategically presenting Quantum mindfulness as an augmentation as this layered approach we showed deep respect for the practitioners existing skills their comfort zones and they're probably surprised us has this approach offers a clear accessible and much less intimidating path towards a deeper more agentic and truly transformative engagement with Consciousness itself this framing really minimizes any potential resistance and maximizes adoption especially for those already familiar with some form of mindfulness inviting them gently the powerfully into a more active role in their own well-being and Transformations that is a truly profound shift moving from just observing to actively participating and shaping of a very provocative statement from our source material that they really challenge is a lot of conventional thinking  about emotions it asks how was anger management controlled in Quantum mindfulness and the answer given is it's not your practice correctly there will be in no anger to have to manage now that's an incredibly bold assertion and one that I think many listeners myself included fine but really intriguing and perhaps honestly a little hard to believe in first class and your to manage how does that work old statement absolutely and it's intentionally provocative I think meant to highlight a fundamental paradigm-shifting distinction in the quantum mindfulness approach to so-called negative emotions we don't aim to manage anger anxiety in the traditional sense that is trying to control or suppress or cope with a feeling after it has already fully Arisen and taken hold why not because within the framework of these emotions are viewed not as monolithic unavoidable entities that just happened to us instead they're seen as an emergent patterns are manifestations of psychological disharmony they are understood as a direct result of misaligned configurations are patterns of interfere  disharmony within your underlying psychodynamic Dimensions like this if the instruments in your inner Symphony Orchestra aren't properly tuned are playing together harmoniously certain discordant note like the feeling we label anger or anxiety will naturally emerged as the dominant sound so instead of just trying to quiet those discordant notes after they start playing Quantum mindfulness aims were three core much more fundamental transformative shifts first and perhaps most importantly it aims for a fundamental re perception the ultimate goal here is the sources to reframe your perspective of what made you anxious in the first place so that it will no longer make you anxious this is a direct active application of what the qm ontology calls the active constitutive Force view of perception in this view perception isn't just a passive reception of what's out there it's understood as an active creative force that literally constitutes or shapes your experience reality for moment-to-moment the ultimate aim here is achieving perceptual freedom.  capacity to consciously choose how potential experiences actually actual eyes for you you become the active Observer and shaper not just a passive recipients of circumstances second-guessing the root cause the dimensional misalignment as we discussed anger or anxiety aren't treated a singular fixed entities they are understood as complex emergent patterns involving specific combinations and interactions underline psychodynamic Dimensions to give you that concrete example for anxiety again deontology describes it as an emergent pattern where the second protective Dimension your inner alarm system become hyperactive the cycle empathic to mention your capacity for connection and compassion contracts or shuts down the psycho motivational to mention your driving energy fragments or get scattered and the cycle receptive to mention your sensitivity subtle cues become hypersensitive and often negative biased so instead of just dealing with the surface label anxiety Quantum mindfulness intervenes directly at this precise dimensional level  the goal is psychodynamic balance restoration actively realigning these fundamental Dimensions rather than simply trying to suppress the emergent feeling itself it's about retuning the instruments of your Symphony so they play harmoniously together naturally and 3rd and this is where that no anger to manage statement truly lands and make sense it's all about emphasizing active intervention over passive reaction was compared against In classical mindfulness when anger or anxiety arises you learn to observe it non-judgmentally you might know the feeling of anger and you practice allowing it to be there and pass through you without identifying with it reacting automatically this is incredibly valuable for reducing the intensity and the duration of the emotional response it helps cultivate a kind of passive Mastery or Equanimity in the face of difficulty Quantum mindfulness however it needs to go significantly further once you've developed the capacity to mindfully observe the state without being completely overwhelmed by it which CM helps with you then I'll learn to actively in  you intervene at the point of reception at the very moment the emotion begins to form or is initially triggered you don't just notice anger you learn to reverse-engineer these emotional states to understand their underlying dimensional components in real-time you actively use your psycho volitional Dimension but pure will and intention to dissolve perceived limitations or substance that are feeling the anger anxiety you also engage you're like a meditative Dimension which encompasses structured thought and analytical reasoning to actively reframe The Narrative around the situation you consciously assigned new more empowering perceived meaning to the situation that initially trigger the negative State this is an active reframing process that leverages your capacity for Pure well for ideation and for reasoning and finally you consciously cultivated super positional cognition the ability to hold multiple possibilities multiple potential interpretations are responses in your mind simultaneously rather than immediately collapsing into a  single predetermine often negative actualize experience you literally expand your menu of choices for how you feel and respond so when we revisit that bold statement about no anger to manage and mindfulness we can explain it concisely for you the listener like this are fundamental aim is to transform the underlying perceptual and internal conditions so that the anger simply doesn't manifest in the first place or if it does arrive as it arises in a dramatically different more constructive and inherently empowered form its pre-emptive transformation maybe think of it with this analogy allowing it to pass without getting swept away by it is excellent for reducing reactivity and game space but Quantum mindfulness as powerful augmentation goes deeper it recognizes that the anger wave itself is a specific type of collapse of your inner mental Quantum field in response to a perceived situation and so we actively work with three key areas to change that pattern first your perception we Act  work to reframe what you're seeing or interpreting in the situation that usually triggers anger instead of automatically perceiving it as a personal attack or a major threat we learned techniques to perceive it differently perhaps as an opportunity for a certain Clarity or for setting a healthy boundary or even understanding the other person's unmet need we use practices like unbinding the fix perception or energetic archetype of cement to literally change the input signal you're reacting to S your inner architecture we understand that the feeling of anger is often a symptom of the specific dimensional misalignment a particular configuration of your inner psychodynamic energy is being temporarily out of balance and Harmony balance restoration actively working to ensure that these dimensions are harmonized and slowing synergistically is that anger isn't the default emergent States you're essentially retuning your inner instruments proactively and 3rd and perhaps most powerfully your active agency  you learn to shift from being a passive experiencer of emotions to becoming an active Observer participant in your own conscious that you're not just watching the show you're actively steering the collapse of potential you guided tours experiences that align with peace or resolve or constructive action rather than defaulting to destructive or unhelpful anger this offer too deeply inspiring new method for achieving genuine emotional Mastery not just management that is truly transformative every friends a whole conversation it's not about suppressing emotions you don't like her about fundamentally changing the underlying conditions the enter landscape it gives rise to that emotion in the first place the goal isn't to manage a disrupt the state that's already taken hold the rather to cultivate a perceptual and internal architecture with a specific patterns that produce that disrupt the state are proactively re pattern dissolved or realigned is naturally leads to a state of Inner Harmony and allows for appropriate nonreactive responses to Life's challenges to have practice correctly and deeply overtime the very  the anger gets transformed its meaning changes that the trigger is transformed and there's no longer anger to manage but perhaps instead would emerge as naturally as Clarity or inner strength or maybe compassionate effective as well as TxTag work one of mine who has practice and operations deepening the dime that's really powerful shift and understanding moving from Simply reacting to life towards proactively Transforming Our experience know it's maybe transition and deep in the dive further exploring some more advanced active intervention practices within the quantum mindfulness framework these are designed as I understand it to engage different psychodynamic dimensions and cognitive mechanisms in new and targeted ways but always Guided by that foundational mental Talisman to work variable concept ensuring that ultimate personal relevance and privacy is maintained these sound like truly inspiring new ideas to consider for Emma wanted to take their personal growth Journey even further indeed these deeper practices offer incredibly profound  ways to interact with and consciously shape your internal landscape moving steadily towards greater agency creativity and Alignment in your life okay first let's look at practice number 5 architecting your days resonance this powerfully leverages the psycho aesthetic to mention pt6 which in the qm framework is understood as the central integrating force of the psyche you can think of it almost like the inner conductor of your personal Orchestra its relative balance your internal experiences with your external reality fostering a profound sense of Harmony Beauty and authenticity of the South the purpose of his practice is to intentionally appreciate your psychodynamic harmonic alignment for your upcoming day or perhaps a specific events this allows you to cultivate a more balanced resident and authentic experience reality proactively so in practice perhaps in the morning before your day even really begins you define a daily reference variable this is how you intended overall energetic and emotional quality of your day to be maybe it's productive Harmony or Cam Focus creative flow  perhaps joyful connection something specific I'm positive you then vividly visualize and feel the qualities of this desired resonance you actively imagine your cycle dynamic dimensions of fundamental aspects of your Consciousness coming into a harmonious balance around the central intention for example you might Center capacity for empathy pd4 and your need for healthy boundaries P5 finding a perfect balance point of compassionate boundaries or you might feel your motivation PT709 in perfectly with your receptivity to Opportunities all orchestrated beautifully by your integrating psycho ass back to mention pt6 as you exhale you gently and intentionally project this harmonize internal State outwards you hold the intention for it to subtly influence the cognitive superposition that field of infinite potential of your days potential experiences gently nudging them towards your desired resonance the profound benefit here is cultivating what the framework calls calculated turbulence which is a kind of dynamic equilibrium  navigate life's inevitable shifts and challenges with Grace instability and enhancing your emotional creativity allowing for proactive shaping of your daily experience rather than just reactive engagement with whatever comes it's literally about designing your days feeling tone from the inside out  okay next practice number 6 deconstructing the inherited script the qm framework explicitly identify the concept of The Inheritance group either those external influences things like societal Norms Family believes passed down through generations cultural narratives we absorb unconsciously that subtly create a kind of false need of architecture within us they often unconsciously shape our thoughts feelings and behaviors without our consent Liberation from inherited scripts is there for a key strategy for Breaking Free from these unseen off in limiting bonds the purpose of this practice is to gain epistemological discernment which is a sophisticated ability to discern true authentic knowledge and experience from borrowed or imposed ones and ultimately to achieve profound authentic self origination allowing your truecore self to emerge by identifying and consciously unraveling these external influences  for this practice you start by identifying a recurring variable this variable represents a thought or feeling or perhaps of behavioural pattern that somehow feels not truly yours or maybe feels externally imposed or outdated this could be a specific fear you can't trace a default - judgment you hold about yourself or others or a habitual way of reacting in certain situations that you suspect you picked up from childhood observation then you engaged in active structural introspection in traditional kabbalistic thought a similar deep contempt of inquiry is known as his phone up you consciously trace the origins of this variable you ask yourself probing questions where did this particular belief or feeling actually come from was it a cultural Narrative of the word from media peers or Society at large was it formal testimony learn from education or authority figures was it shaped by an interpersonal relationship experience with a parent partner or influential friend or is it simply a learned behavior repertoire that was modeled for you and you adopted unconsciously this is your tray  Origins face once you have a clear sense of the origin you consciously work to decouple this variable from your true authentic self you actively use your psycho volitional Dimension your pure will and core intention to assert your internal sovereignty declaring internally this script is not me it is not my true nature and you use your cycle meditative Dimension pt3 your capacity for thought and analytical reasoning to logically deconstruct the scripts internal logic perhaps exposing its flaws its contradictions or it's simple in applicability to your true self in your current life you then vividly imagined this inherited script dissolving losing its binding power over you clearing vast Inner Space for yourself and architecture your true authentic internal operating system to emerge and guide you the benefit here is fostering genuine authentic self origination and significantly reducing ontological misalignment that unsettling off in background feeling when your internal reality doesn't align with who you truly are deeply inspired  wow okay to take becoming a kind of archaeologist or detective of your own mind uncovering the Unseen blueprints or may be outdated programs that might be running your life without your kind of consent and then consciously choosing to rewrite them or uninstall them entirely that sounds incredibly liberating actually liberating yes precisely next up is practice number seven Quantum decision navigation this practice highlights of the dynamic interplay of three key Dimensions your psycho volitional Dimension pd-1 your pure will your power to direct focus and attention your cycle meditative Dimension pd3 your capacity for structure thought analysis and reasoning and you're psycho receptive Dimension pd8 your ability to refine perception tune in to settle feedback and receive guidance all of these work together synergistically in what the framework called vectorized awareness which is attention that is both focused and intentionally directed the purpose of this practice is to enable you to make  more lines more effective and truly resident decision especially complex ones by actively navigating the cognitive superposition of possibilities that are inherent in any significant Choice rather than feeling overwhelmed confused or Paralyzed by the options so two practices you first to find the decision variable your current choicepoint the specific decision you need to make you been consciously allow all potential outcomes or viable options related to this decision to exist simultaneously in your mind you hold them as mental quanta or probabilistic mental state within your cognitive superposition you intentionally resist the urge to immediately pick an option judge the possibilities or narrow the field down prematurely instead you hold the entire field of possibility open with curiosity then you use your psycho volitional to mention p12 intentionally direct your focus to wear nice to each option one by one exploring it fully you use your second meditative Dimension p34 analytical reasoning to systematically map both the felt sense out of this option feeling my body and my gut and The Logical  vacations what are the likely consequences of each potential outcome this isn't just about making Pro con list it's about deeply feeling into the residence of each possibility you also actively engage your cycle receptive to mention pdh to tune in to settle feedback you asked your inner wisdom how each option feels doesn't bring a sense of inner Clarity expansion and rightness or does it create dissonance contractional Ronnie's you listen for Proto impulses subtle inclinations or principal receptivity finally won a clear resident path emerges one that feels truly aligned with logically and intuitively you use your focus conscious attention to intentionally collapse the field of possibilities into your chosen actualized experience you affirm your decision with clear intention and commitment the profound benefit of his practice is greatly enhanced decision-making the cultivation of paradox tolerance being comfortable holding multiple possibilities are ambiguities without needing immediate resolution and a  simply avoiding the often debilitating states of cognitive overwhelm or decision paralysis when faced with complex choices that sounds like an absolute superpower for any one of the struggles with big decisions turning would often feels like an overwhelming fog of choices into a clear intentional path forward I can imagine that inspiring a lot of people to approach challenges in Forks in the road very differently absolutely can be it turns a potential source of Stress and Anxiety into a structured process for accessing inner wisdom and power and finally let's have some practice number 8 conscious dream weaving this practice specifically leverages your psycho foundational Dimension pd9 which the qm ontology defined as representing the deepest layers of the subconscious your Primal drives and the repository of memory this Dimension is understood to be crucial for consolidating memory during sleep and encoding your experience of learning at a very fundamental often pre-verbal level the purpose of this practice is to intentional influence your subconscious infrastructure  it's about consciously choosing to consolidate desired trait variables like new beliefs you want to embody character traits you wish to cultivate like courage or patients or habits do you want to install and proactively preparing a deep inner landscape for their desired manifestation in your Waking Life so to practice this typically performed in the evening before sleep or perhaps during a quiet liminal meditative State you first to find a Dream Weaver variable this is the specific quality belief or release you want your subconscious mind to work on and integrate while you rest perhaps it's a deeper sense of self-confidence the gentle release of a past hurt or was that or maybe access to a new creative capacity you then visualize its ideal form or feeling State and actively plant it with intention into your psycho foundational Dimension pd9 you imagine it's sinking deep into your subconscious ready to be Consolidated process and generated into your being during your sleep cycle you might also identify any known vulnerability structure like a deep-seated fear  emotional reactivity pattern between negative reaction that might be hindering your variables full expression you can consciously instruct your cycle foundational Dimension pt92 gently deconstruct or released these hindering patterns during sleep upon waking you consciously pay attention noticing any subtle shifts in your mood perspective inside their feelings of integration that may have occurred seemingly overnight as your second Foundation Dimension generates these newly seeded structures and patterns into your conscious awareness the profound benefit here is the potential for deeper more sustainable belief formation the possibility of radical psychological transformation via ontological reassignment occurring at a fundamental subconscious level and getting a powerful new method for working with the traditional elusive empirical absence of the unconscious actively influencing those parts of you that operate beneath conscious awareness but profoundly shape your life Wow with those striking but all these Quantum mindfulness practice is really from the basic Temple the group session we started with right through these more advanced deeply personal take  bike dream weaving is it they seem designed to be functionally understandable incredibly actionable while still carrying the Deep transformative power of this quite intricate kabbalistic inspired Quantum mindfulness ontology they truly moved far beyond just passive observation in the wrongs of active intentional creation inner architecture design and genuine self-mastery it's a genuinely inspiring set of new methods and ideas the really could change how you approach your inner life and your potential hash tag tag tag tag outro after all that was only for you listening right now today we've taken a really deep dive and what feels like an incredibly Innovative approach to personal transformation we explored Howard templated variables Rhythm method allows for profound individualize growth even within a group contacts out completely transforms the very nature of how we can engage with our in a world we seen how this framework moves far beyond merely managing difficult States like anger or anxiety aiming instead to actively re pattern the underlying architecture  syrians itself it's not about just suppressing the symptoms is it it's about Transformer the root cause I really hope you take away from this deep dive today these new methods and ideas drawn from Quantum mindfulness offer a tangible pathway towards what the framework calls perceptual Freedom that remarkable ability to consciously choose how you perceive and therefore how you experience your reality and towards achieving genuine psychodynamic balance restoration within yourself this isn't just about feeling a bit better temporarily it's about gaining true agency it's about becoming a truly empowered Observer participant in the unfolding of your own Consciousness it's about being equipped with tools to actively steer your internal reality cultivating greater well-being resilience and purpose me inside out which really hope this inspires you to rethink the vast possibilities that exist for your own personal growth and your ongoing journey of well-being explore on your own  consider just How Deeply ingrained are everyday linguistic labels words like anxiety anger failure to success are in shaping or perceived reality is simply changing the word internally or how we feel the concept using a neutral variable can alter the interstate or even prevent the negative one from arising the first place well what other unseen scripts are unquestioned labels are we inadvertently reinforcing in our lives today in the day with the greatest Freedom the most profound inspiration for New Growth actually lies and actively consciously designing the very language of your own inner experience think about that until our next date.
