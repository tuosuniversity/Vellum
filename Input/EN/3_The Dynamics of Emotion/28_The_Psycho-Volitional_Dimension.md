## Introduction

In modern psychodynamic thought, consciousness is seen as a layered system made up of ten connected dimensions. This chapter focuses on the **Psycho-Volitional Dimension**, which is the very first and most basic layer of what's called the Primary Modality of consciousness.

This dimensional approach describes consciousness as a complex hierarchy of mental and experiential processes. These processes develop in a specific order, yet they are all connected. The Psycho-Volitional Dimension is the most important part of this structure. It acts as the active starting point from which all other mental events develop.

This dimension defines the core connection between will, consciousness, and our ability to act. In this dimensional model, the Psycho-Volitional is seen as the fundamental source from which consciousness itself originates. This understanding shapes how we view human independence, creative ability, and the basic nature of personal experience.

## **28.1:** Foundational Nature and Core Characteristics
### Learning Objectives

-   **Learning Objectives:**
    - Explain how the Psycho-Volitional Dimension combines pure consciousness and primal will.
    - Describe the concept of forming will *before* conscious awareness and its role in our ability to act.
    - Analyze the importance of the "divine rupture" in the creation of our individual self.

### The Confluence of Consciousness and Will

The Psycho-Volitional Dimension is where **pure consciousness** and **primal will** meet. This meeting forms a basic unity that comes before, and is the foundation for, how our experiences separate into distinct mental categories. This dimension represents raw, undifferentiated energy that exists before any specific thoughts, emotions, or sensory information appear (Wallace, 2017).

Imagine an artist facing a blank canvas, pausing before making the first brushstroke. In that moment, there's a state of pure potential. Nothing is set in stone yet, but it's full of endless creative possibilities. This is like the Psycho-Volitional Dimension: a field of pure potential that holds the beginnings of everything that could possibly manifest. It stays in this undifferentiated state until an act of will activates it.

This dimension goes beyond the usual idea of will as a conscious process of weighing options and making decisions. Instead, it represents **ontological will**. This is a type of will that is built into the very nature of existence itself (May, 1969). This deeper, fundamental will works below our conscious awareness, constantly creating the basic drive towards existing, expressing ourselves, and bringing new things into being – all of which are hallmarks of conscious life.

### Pre-Conscious Will and Agency

The processes happening within the Psycho-Volitional Dimension are what we call **pre-conscious will formation**. These are the basic activities that take place *before* our intentions become clear in our conscious minds. This pre-conscious layer of willing acts like the 'engine room' of our ability to act (agency). It's the unseen source that gives all our conscious choices and deliberate actions their energy and direction (Wegner, 2002).

In therapy, we see this principle at work when clients have sudden breakthroughs or insights that seem to come from nowhere. For example, someone who always struggles with making decisions might suddenly act with clear purpose. This isn't because they've thought through their options more carefully. Instead, it's because the Psycho-Volitional Dimension has aligned itself with a specific path. The conscious mind experiences this as an intuitive knowing—a direct sense of what feels fundamentally right or needed, beyond logical thought.

This 'engine of agency' works differently from the step-by-step, deliberate way we make conscious decisions. Instead of following logical reasoning, the Psycho-Volitional Dimension shows up as sudden, disconnected bursts of clarity, purpose, or direction. These are truly new ideas or impulses, not just new combinations of old thoughts.

### The Rupture and the Genesis of Self

The most significant aspect of the Psycho-Volitional Dimension is its part in the "divine rupture" that gives birth to our sense of self. This is a fundamental break in the continuous flow of undifferentiated consciousness—a primal splitting open that allows our individual self to emerge from the undifferentiated state of being (Jung, 1968).

The divine rupture is the crucial point where universal consciousness starts to divide into individual points of experience. This isn't a single event from the past; it's an ongoing process that constantly recreates the basis of our personal identity and our ability to act. Every real choice we make, every true creative expression, and every time we overcome past limits is a new example of this original rupture appearing.

Think about falling deeply in love—not the slow growth of affection, but that sudden, powerful realization that completely changes your outlook on life. In these moments, people often say they feel fundamentally different, as if a new self has been born. This is an example of the divine rupture at work: the Psycho-Volitional Dimension showing its ability to create truly new ways of being and relating.

This feature shows that the dimension is fundamentally wild and cannot be controlled. Unlike other parts of our personality that can be shaped, trained, or programmed through repeated experiences, the Psycho-Volitional Dimension works based on its own inherent rules. It doesn't need approval from our conscious ego to appear, nor does it conform to what society expects or demands. In this way, it represents the essential core of human authenticity—the part of us that stays truly free, no matter the external situation.

**Section 1 Summary:** The Psycho-Volitional Dimension is the fundamental layer of consciousness, formed by the meeting of pure consciousness and primal, basic will. It acts as "ontological will," constantly creating the basic drive towards existence. This dimension is responsible for "pre-conscious will formation," serving as the core source of our ability to act, leading to sudden, new moments of clarity and purpose. Most importantly, it causes the "divine rupture," a continuous process that creates our individual self from an undifferentiated state, representing the wild and authentic core of who we are.

## **28.2:** Structural Position and Cognitive Architecture
### Learning Objectives

-   **Learning Objectives:**
    - Explain the concept of dimensional priority and what it means for how our minds develop.
    - Describe the Psycho-Volitional Dimension as a unified "Psycho-Volitional Field."
    - Analyze how the Psycho-Volitional Field controls the formation of intentions through mental alignment.

### Dimensional Primacy

Placing the Psycho-Volitional Dimension as the very first element in the ten-dimensional framework shows its fundamental importance as a cause and origin. This importance shapes how all other mental processes develop. This priority means that the order of these dimensions represents a hierarchy of emergence, where one stage causes the next to appear over time (Wilber, 2000).

In developmental psychology, we see this primary importance in the earliest stages of a baby's consciousness. Before language, abstract thought, or stable emotions form, there's a pure impulse of will. This is the baby's basic drive toward life, growth, and interacting with the world (Stern, 1985). This basic will appears as the infant's ability to influence their surroundings through crying, grasping, and other purposeful actions, even before they develop self-awareness or conscious planning.

Because this dimension is the foundational element of the Primary Modality, it serves as the source from which the entire conscious mind develops. The impulse of will provides the essential mental energy that powers and brings to life all other psychological functions. Without this basic activation, the complex mental abilities that define mature human consciousness wouldn't have the dynamic energy needed to work.

### The Psycho-Volitional Field

The Psycho-Volitional Dimension functions as the **Psycho-Volitional Field**. This is a dynamic, unified field of awareness, not just a single psychological function. This field is the highest level of cognitive dimension. It's marked by a state of integrated consciousness that emerges and goes beyond the fragmented way our ordinary minds usually work (Deikman, 1990).

This field spreads throughout our entire mental structure, influencing and energizing all other dimensions while keeping its own unique traits and roles. This unified awareness shows up in 'peak experiences'—moments when people feel completely whole, purposeful, and connected to deeper meanings (Maslow, 1964).

Athletes describe this state as being 'in the zone,' where conscious effort disappears into effortless action that seems to come from a source beyond their normal will. Artists talk about creative states where their work seems to create itself through them, as if they are clear channels for a creative force that goes beyond their personal will, yet works through their unique artistic abilities.

### Cognitive Alignment and Intention

The Psycho-Volitional Field controls how intentions form through "cognitive alignment." This field holds many possible directions and outcomes at the same time. These possibilities exist until a conscious choice or unconscious alignment causes one specific possibility to become a definite intention. This process, where potential 'collapses' into reality, is the fundamental way pure consciousness turns into specific thoughts, emotions, and actions.

This 'alignment' means coordinating the Psycho-Volitional Field with deeper, fundamental principles of reality. This suggests that forming effective intentions isn't just about using your personal will. It also requires aligning your individual will with universal patterns and principles that go beyond your individual ego. This kind of alignment allows access to creative and transformative potentials that are far greater than what you could achieve through personal effort alone.

**Section 2 Summary:** The Psycho-Volitional Dimension has "dimensional primacy" because it is the first and most fundamental element in the ten-dimensional framework. It provides the essential energy for all subsequent mental processes, which can even be seen in infant development. It operates as the "Psycho-Volitional Field," a dynamic, unified field of awareness that represents the highest level of cognitive dimension, permeating and energizing the entire mental structure. This field guides the formation of intentions through "cognitive alignment," where potential possibilities become real. This process highlights the importance of aligning individual will with universal principles for effective manifestation.

## **28.3:** Functional Properties and Capabilities
### Learning Objectives

-   **Learning Objectives:**
    - Explain the "annihilative property" of the Psycho-Volitional Dimension and its role in transformation.
    - Describe how the Psycho-Volitional Dimension acts as the source of human free will.
    - Illustrate the step-by-step relationships between the Psycho-Volitional Dimension and the dimensions that follow in the flow of thought.

### The Annihilative Property

One of the most unique and transformative features of the Psycho-Volitional Dimension is its **annihilative property**. This is its ability to dissolve perceived limitations and get rid of boundaries that we impose on ourselves or that are placed on us by external conditions. This property doesn't work by destroying things in the usual sense. Instead, it's a more fundamental process of breaking down that creates room for new possibilities to appear (Kaplan, 1964).

The annihilative property means it can reduce limiting beliefs, restrictive patterns, and confining identities to their core nothingness. It shows that these are simply mental constructs, not unchangeable realities. This process of breaking down old structures creates the mental space needed for real transformation and growth.

Think about people who overcome long-standing phobias through what seems like a sudden change in how they relate to fear. Someone with a lifelong fear of public speaking might suddenly volunteer to give presentations. This isn't because they slowly built confidence through gradual exposure. Instead, something fundamental has changed in how they see the feared situation. The annihilative property has dissolved the mental construct of their limitation, revealing new possibilities that were always there but previously hidden.

This ability works through a dual process of **affirmation** and **negation**. Affirmation means actively choosing and energizing desired outcomes. Negation means consciously letting go of and dissolving other options, restrictions, and limitations. These aren't separate steps; they happen at the same time as part of a single act of will. When someone deeply commits to a new life direction, they are simultaneously affirming their chosen path and letting go of their attachment to all the other possibilities they could have followed.

### Free Will and Self-Direction

The Psycho-Volitional Dimension is the fundamental source and protector of human **free will** within the Quantum Mindfulness framework. This dimension is the core origin point from which truly new ideas and self-direction emerge (James, 1890).

The idea that this dimension is the source of free will comes from observing that humans can go beyond their conditioning, override instincts, and create truly new responses to challenges. If consciousness were completely determined by past causes, these abilities would be impossible. The very existence of creativity, moral responsibility, and transformative change confirms that there's a faculty that can start something genuinely new, rather than just rearranging existing elements based on fixed rules.

This understanding of free will works by aligning individual will with universal principles and potentials. True freedom doesn't come from choosing randomly. Instead, it comes from being able to choose in harmony with deeper patterns of meaning and purpose that go beyond the limits of our individual ego.

Every exercise of free will involves 'collapsed emotions.' This means that the potential energy within emotional states is directed and given shape through acts of will. This shows that emotions aren't just subjective feelings; they carry potential that can be made real through conscious choice and direction. For example, someone who turns their anger into productive action, their fear into careful preparation, or their love into creative expression is demonstrating this principle.

### Dimension Relationships and Cognitive Flow

The Psycho-Volitional Dimension acts as the starting force within our mental structure, establishing its fundamental connection to all other dimensions that follow. The raw, undifferentiated impulse of will that comes from this dimension provides the essential energy and direction that power the entire series of psychological processes that make up conscious experience.

The dimension that immediately follows in this hierarchy is the **Psycho-Conceptive Dimension**. This is where the pure impulse of will first starts to take shape as new ideas. This shift shows the basic movement from raw, undifferentiated potential to distinct, manifested forms, which is a key feature of this dimensional sequence. The pure will from the Psycho-Volitional Dimension first expresses itself as insight, intuition, or basic conceptual understanding within the Psycho-Conceptive Dimension.

We can see this step-by-step emergence in creative discovery. A scientist working on a complex problem might have a sudden breakthrough. This isn't from logical deduction, but from a pure impulse of will to understand, which then takes the form of a specific insight or hypothesis. The shift from the unspoken knowing of the breakthrough moment to putting it into words as a testable hypothesis shows the transition from the Psycho-Volitional to the Psycho-Conceptive Dimension.

The flow continues through the hierarchy of dimensions. The Psycho-Volitional Dimension stays connected to all the levels that follow, while still keeping its unique role as the foundational source. Its connection to the third dimension—the **Psycho-Meditative Dimension**, which deals with more structured, binary ways of thinking—happens through the Psycho-Conceptive Dimension. This shows how the pure will from the foundational dimension becomes more and more distinct and structured as it moves through our mental system.

Understanding these connections shows the Psycho-Volitional Dimension's role as the ultimate origin of "psychodynamic collapse." This is the ongoing process where potential becomes real through different levels of manifestation. Each dimension represents a specific stage in this collapse, from the undifferentiated potential of pure will to the highly structured and distinct processes of mature conscious thought.

**Section 3 Summary:** The Psycho-Volitional Dimension has an "annihilative property," meaning it can dissolve perceived limitations by actively choosing desired outcomes and letting go of restrictions, which creates room for transformation. It is the fundamental source of human "free will" within Quantum Mindfulness, allowing for true novelty and self-direction by aligning individual will with universal principles. This dimension initiates the flow of thought, providing the basic impulse of will that then takes shape as ideas in the Psycho-Conceptive Dimension and becomes more structured in the Psycho-Meditative Dimension. This illustrates the process of "psychodynamic collapse," where undifferentiated potential becomes clear and distinct.

## **28.4:** The Vertical Map of Consciousness and Human Potential
### Learning Objectives

-   **Learning Objectives:**
    - Explain the Psycho-Volitional Dimension's position as the highest point on the vertical map of consciousness.
    - Discuss what accessing this dimension means for psychological transformation and human potential.
    - Analyze how the Psycho-Volitional Dimension solves the conflict between human freedom and psychological determinism.

The Psycho-Volitional Dimension is the highest point on the "vertical map of consciousness." This is a level of being and functioning that exists before we are shaped by conditioning, limited by concepts, or influenced by cognitive biases that build up through our experiences and social interactions (Tart, 1975). This position has deep implications for understanding what humans are capable of and the potential for psychological change and growth.

Because this dimension operates before any interference, the Psycho-Volitional Dimension keeps access to the full range of human potential. This potential exists before cultural conditioning and personal history start to narrow it down. This suggests that therapy and developmental programs are most effective when they can reach and activate this foundational level, rather than just dealing with symptoms and patterns that appear at more superficial levels of psychological functioning.

Recognizing the Psycho-Volitional Dimension as the core source of consciousness helps us understand phenomena that challenge traditional psychological models. Things like spontaneous healing, sudden personality changes, mystical experiences, and creative breakthroughs can be seen as examples of this dimension's ability to create truly new things and go beyond existing patterns of limitation.

Moreover, this dimension's role as the source of individual agency within a structured psychodynamic framework resolves the seeming conflict between human freedom and psychological determinism. While the overall structure of consciousness follows universal patterns and rules, the specific way potential becomes real for each person—how they uniquely bring potential into being—originates from the Psycho-Volitional Dimension and remains fundamentally personal and free.

This understanding opens new paths for research into consciousness, creativity, and human transformation. By focusing on the basic level of pure will and how it relates to other mental processes, researchers and practitioners can develop more effective ways to help people make positive changes and realize their full potential. Therefore, the Psycho-Volitional Dimension is not just a theoretical concept; it's a practical way to understand and access the deepest sources of human creativity, resilience, and capacity for change.

The implications go beyond individual psychology, touching on larger questions about the nature of consciousness, whether true novelty is possible in the universe, and how individual agency relates to universal principles. As such, the Psycho-Volitional Dimension is both the peak of current understanding and a foundation for future investigations into the most fundamental questions of human existence and potential.

**Section 4 Summary:** The Psycho-Volitional Dimension is seen as the highest point on the "vertical map of consciousness." It exists before conditioning and provides access to the full range of human potential, making it vital for effective therapy and personal development. Its ability to create truly new things helps explain phenomena like spontaneous healing and sudden insights. Crucially, it resolves the tension between human freedom and psychological determinism by being the core source of individual agency and the unique way each person brings potential into reality. This understanding opens new avenues for research into consciousness, creativity, and transformation.

## Summary

Chapter 17 introduces the Psycho-Volitional Dimension as the foundational and most fundamental layer of consciousness within a ten-dimensional framework. This dimension is defined by the meeting of pure consciousness and primal, basic will. It acts as the core source from which all other mental events emerge. It works through "pre-conscious will formation," serving as the engine of our ability to act, generating new impulses and insights. A key aspect is the "divine rupture," an ongoing process through which our individual self emerges from an undifferentiated state of being, representing the wild and authentic core of who we are.

Structurally, the Psycho-Volitional Dimension holds "dimensional primacy," providing the essential energy for the entire conscious mind, evident from early infant development. It functions as the "Psycho-Volitional Field," a unified, highest-level cognitive dimension that spreads throughout and energizes all other dimensions. This field guides the formation of intentions through "cognitive alignment," where individual will connects with universal principles to bring potential into reality.

Functionally, the dimension has an "annihilative property," which means it can dissolve perceived limitations and create room for transformation through simultaneous affirmation and negation. It is the fundamental source of human "free will" within Quantum Mindfulness, enabling true novelty and self-direction by aligning with deeper patterns of meaning. The Psycho-Volitional Dimension initiates the flow of thought, providing the raw impulse of will that then takes shape as ideas in the Psycho-Conceptive Dimension and becomes more structured in the Psycho-Meditative Dimension, illustrating the process of "psychodynamic collapse."

Ultimately, the Psycho-Volitional Dimension represents the highest point on the "vertical map of consciousness," offering access to the full range of human potential before it is shaped by conditioning. Understanding it is crucial for effective therapeutic interventions, and it helps explain phenomena like spontaneous healing and sudden breakthroughs. By being the core source of individual agency, it resolves the tension between human freedom and psychological determinism, opening new avenues for research into consciousness, creativity, and transformation.

## Answer Key

1.  The Psycho-Volitional Dimension is formed by the meeting of **pure consciousness** and **primal will**. This differs from common ideas of will (as a conscious, deliberate choice) because it represents "ontological will"—a will that is fundamental to existence itself. It works below conscious awareness to constantly create the basic drive towards existing and manifesting, rather than being solely about conscious decision-making.
2.  **Pre-conscious will formation** refers to the basic activities within the Psycho-Volitional Dimension that happen before intentions become consciously clear. It acts as the "engine room of agency," the unseen source from which conscious choices and actions get their energy and direction. An example from the text is when therapy clients experience sudden breakthroughs or insights without logical reasons, acting with clarity because the Psycho-Volitional Dimension has aligned itself.
3.  The **divine rupture** is a fundamental break in undifferentiated consciousness, a primal splitting open through which our individual self emerges from the undifferentiated state of being. It is not a single past event but an ongoing process that continuously recreates our personal identity and our ability to act. It represents the dimension's capacity to create truly new things and the irreducible core of human authenticity.
4.  The Psycho-Volitional Dimension functions as a **"Psycho-Volitional Field,"** which is a dynamic, unified field of awareness, not just a single mental function. It is the highest level of cognitive dimension, spreading throughout and energizing all other dimensions. **Cognitive alignment** is the process within this field where a conscious choice or unconscious connection causes one potential direction to become a clear intention. Its importance is that forming effective intentions requires aligning individual will with deeper, universal patterns and principles, going beyond the ego's limits to access greater creative potentials.
5.  The **annihilative property** is the Psycho-Volitional Dimension's ability to dissolve perceived limitations and get rid of boundaries that we impose on ourselves or that are placed on us by external conditions. It helps bring about transformation by reducing limiting beliefs and restrictive identities to their core nothingness, creating mental space for new possibilities. This ability works through the dual actions of **affirmation** (actively choosing and energizing desired outcomes) and **negation** (consciously letting go of and dissolving other options, restrictions, and limitations), which happen at the same time as part of a single act of will.
