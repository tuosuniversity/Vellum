  

Traditional Description: Impermanence (Anicca).

Quantum Description: Discrete State Dynamics: The core operating principle of the psychodynamic architecture, which posits that consciousness is not a continuous stream but a series of distinct Psychodynamic Wave Collapse events. Each Overall Mental State (S) is a temporary, Actualized Experience that is immediately superseded by the next cycle of observation and collapse. Understanding this principle reframes impermanence from a passive observation about reality to the fundamental, non-negotiable mechanism of cognitive processing.

Methodology: This methodology re-engineers the philosophical concept of impermanence into a fundamental law of cognitive physics. It asserts that change is not merely a property of experiences, but is the result of the underlying mechanism of discrete state actualization through which all mental phenomena are generated and replaced.

### Analysis as a Framework Principle

1. Function and Categorization:

Within the specified framework, Discrete State Dynamics is not a practice but a core Framework Principle. It functions as the system's fundamental "law of cognitive physics", describing the nature of how consciousness operates over time. It is not a method to be performed but a verifiable description of reality to be understood through practice. It posits that "consciousness is not a continuous stream but a series of distinct Psychodynamic Wave Collapse events", thereby providing the ultimate rationale for the practice of non-attachment.

2. State of Realization:

A practitioner who fully realizes this principle experientially does not just believe in impermanence; they perceive it directly as the "fundamental, non-negotiable mechanism of cognitive processing".

- They understand that any given "Overall Mental State (S) is a temporary, Actualized Experience".
- They see that clinging to any state is fundamentally at odds with the "underlying mechanism of discrete state actualization".
- This realization naturally gives rise to the skill of "Dynamic State Cycling" (letting go), as fighting the discrete nature of consciousness is understood to be both futile and inefficient.

3. Relationship to the Practices:

This principle is not practiced directly, but is experientially validated through both Foundational and Architectural work.

- **Role of Foundational Practices:** Practices like "Observing Thoughts" and "Dynamic State Cycling" are the primary means by which a practitioner can directly observe the moment-by-moment replacement of one "Actualized Experience" with the next. This provides the direct, first-person data to validate the principle.
- **Role of Architectural Practices:** Advanced analytical practices like "Reverse Engineering Collapse Patterns" can provide an even more granular insight into a single "Psychodynamic Wave Collapse event", further confirming the discrete and sequential nature of mental processing.

4. Core Purpose:

The core purpose of this principle is to reframe "impermanence from a passive observation about reality to the fundamental, non-negotiable mechanism of cognitive processing".
