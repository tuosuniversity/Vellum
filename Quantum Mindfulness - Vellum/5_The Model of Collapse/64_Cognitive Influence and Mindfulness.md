# Chapter 64: How We Judge and Form Beliefs

This chapter explores the core process of **cognitive appraisal**, looking at how our minds turn raw observations into an overall judgment. It introduces the Cognitive Appraisal equation as a key part of the psychodynamic model and shows how mindfulness practices can influence its different parts. Furthermore, it investigates how beliefs are formed, using case studies to demonstrate how repeated experiences, especially those linked to specific psychological patterns, can lead to lasting changes in a person's core personality and how they see the world.

## Introduction: From Observation to Judgment

A key part of how our minds work is the moment we turn something we observe into a meaningful judgment. This isn't a simple, direct conversion. Instead, it's a complicated mix of what's happening now, how we've felt in the past, and our natural personal tendencies. Understanding how this works is essential for understanding how our consciousness is built. This chapter introduces **Cognitive Appraisal (C)** as the main "control signal" in the psychodynamic model. It's the core process that decides if a situation is good, bad, or neutral, and then triggers other parts of the mind to respond.

We'll start by breaking down the Cognitive Appraisal equation. We'll look at the different forces that shape its outcome: what's happening right now, how past moods linger, and our natural personal inclinations. After that, we'll explore how specific practices, like Classical and Quantum Mindfulness, can deliberately influence this process. Classical Mindfulness mainly helps regulate our reactions by making them less intense. Quantum Mindfulness, however, offers a way to actively change how we see things to create positive results.

Finally, this chapter will explore the important idea that "practice becomes belief." Through a series of case studies, we'll show that beliefs aren't always formed through logical thinking. Instead, repeated emotional, social, and relationship experiences can strongly shape them. By looking at how these experiences affect the basic characteristics within the psychodynamic model, we'll show how the mind can develop new, stable ways of seeing the world – even ones that go against common societal views. This exploration gives us a strong framework for understanding how human beliefs are dynamic and often not based on pure logic.

## **60.1:** The Cognitive Appraisal (C) Equation

### Learning Objectives

*   Explain the three main parts of the Cognitive Appraisal equation.
*   Understand how "Personal Tendency" weights adjust the equation's inputs.
*   Describe how the Cognitive Appraisal process is dynamic and can involve repeated adjustments.

### The Master Control Signal

**Cognitive Appraisal (C)** is the main "control signal" that turns a complex observation into one overall judgment. This judgment then acts as the primary instruction that activates other parts of the psychodynamic model. This idea – that how we *interpret* an event, not the event itself, determines our reaction – is a core concept in psychology (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). The final C value shows the mind's overall assessment of a situation, like "this is a threat," "this is an opportunity," or "this is neutral."

The equation balances three distinct forces to arrive at this single judgment:

$$C = w_{\Psi} \cdot \text{Valence}(\Psi) + w_{S} \cdot \text{AvgValence}(S_{t-1}) + \text{Bias}_{M_1}$$

### Core Components of the Appraisal

1.  **The Impact of the Now: $w_{\Psi} \cdot \text{Valence}(\Psi)$** This term represents the immediate impact of the current event.
    *   $\text{Valence}(\Psi)$ is the initial positive or negative feeling the mind attaches to an observation. For instance, seeing a snake might create a very negative feeling, while hearing good news would create a positive one.
    *   $w_{\Psi}$ is a "**Personal Tendency**" weight that shows *how much a person is affected by new events*. Someone with a high $w_{\Psi}$ reacts strongly and is very sensitive to the present moment, while someone with a low $w_{\Psi}$ is more detached or less affected by immediate events.
2.  **The Inertia of the Past: $w_{S} \cdot \text{AvgValence}(S_{t-1})$** This part shows how your "lingering overall mood" from your previous mental state affects you. It acknowledges that your emotional state at one moment carries over to the next, influencing your memory and judgments (Bower, 1981).
    *   $\text{AvgValence}(S_{t-1})$ is the feeling that carries over from the last moment. If you were already happy, this value is positive; if anxious, it's negative.
    *   $w_S$ is a "**Personal Tendency**" weight that shows *how much a person's mood tends to "stick."* Someone with a high $w_S$ experiences moods that have strong momentum, meaning a bad morning could spoil their whole day. Someone with a low $w_S$ tends to get over things quickly.
3.  **The Inherent Disposition: $\text{Bias}_{M_1}$** This term is a basic, constant factor based on your Prime Modality's core nature. It represents your natural tendencies, such as optimism (a positive bias) or pessimism (a negative bias). This value doesn't depend on the current situation or your previous mood; it's a fixed part of your personality that consistently pushes your judgment in a specific direction.

It's also important that C is dynamic and can be re-evaluated. Your Prime Modality can quickly re-assess an initial judgment ($C_{\text{initial}}$) to create a more refined one ($C_{\text{updated}}$).

## **60.2:** Mindfulness and Cognitive Intervention

### Learning Objectives

*   Explain how Classical and Quantum Mindfulness affect the different parts of the Cognitive Appraisal equation.
*   Describe the psychological difference between "observing without reacting" and "intentionally changing your perspective."
*   Explain how active reframing works using the Prime Modality.

### Interfacing with the Cognitive Appraisal

The Cognitive Appraisal equation gives us a clear way to understand how deliberate practices can shape our mental state. Two different types of mindfulness—one passive and one active—interact with the equation's variables in very different ways.

#### Classical Mindfulness (Passive)

This type of mindfulness is mainly a practice that **regulates or reduces intensity**. Its main job is to lessen strong emotional reactions and stop negative feelings from getting out of control.

*   **The Goal:** To make a *negative* Cognitive Influence ($I_{Cj}$) neutral. This means stopping a negative main signal (C) from strongly activating negative parts of the mind (like fear or anger).
*   **How it Works:** It does this by focusing on the parts of the Cognitive Appraisal equation that control how we react and how moods persist:
    *   "**Lowering $w_{\Psi}$**": By training your mind to react less to immediate events, a negative observation's $\text{Valence}(\Psi)$ has less impact on C.
    *   "**Lowering $w_{S}$**": By learning not to cling to passing emotional states, the lingering effect of a negative previous mood ($\text{AvgValence}(S_{t-1})$) is reduced.
    *   "**Making $\text{Valence}(\Psi)$ neutral**": This practice involves observing sensations and thoughts without judgment, which brings an event's $\text{Valence}(\Psi)$ closer to zero.

Essentially, Classical Mindfulness reduces the connection between negative experiences and the resulting mental judgment. It is a practice of **observing without reacting**, where you learn to see thoughts and feelings as temporary mental events, not as absolute reality (Segal, Williams, & Teasdale, 2013).

#### Quantum Mindfulness (Active)

This is a more advanced practice that **transforms or reframes**. It doesn't just lessen negativity; it actively aims to create a positive outcome by changing how we perceive things at a fundamental level.

*   **The Goal:** To change perception itself, making sure the Cognitive Influence ($I_{Cj}$) becomes *positive*, even during a difficult event. This means making the main signal C positive.
*   **How it Works:** It includes the regulating effects of Classical Mindfulness but adds two powerful, direct actions:
    *   **Actively Changing $\text{Valence}(\Psi)$**: This goes beyond simply making things neutral. It's the practice of finding the positive potential, the opportunity, or the lesson in any observation. It means consciously changing a "threat" into a "challenge," which shifts $\text{Valence}(\Psi)$ from a negative to a positive value. This method is well-known in emotion regulation research as cognitive reappraisal (Gross, 2002).
    *   **Changing $\text{Bias}_{M_1}$**: This is the most significant effect. It suggests that consistent active practice can fundamentally change the mind's basic outlook, moving a pessimistic or anxious bias towards optimism, curiosity, or confidence.

Essentially, Quantum Mindfulness is a practice of **creating meaning and intentionally changing your perspective**.

## **60.3:** The Mechanism of Belief Formation

### Learning Objectives

*   Explain the idea that "practice becomes belief" within the psychodynamic model.
*   Examine how social and emotional factors can change long-term Traits ($T_j$).
*   Assess how the model can explain conflicts between personal and societal values.

### How Practice Becomes Belief

New beliefs can form in ways that aren't purely logical, often through social or emotional experiences. The model explains this by showing how repeated experiences, especially those linked to specific aspects within the **Secondary Modality ($M_2$)**, can permanently change a person's basic **Trait ($T_j$)** for a related topic. This idea is supported by research showing that direct personal experience strongly influences attitudes and beliefs (Ajzen & Fishbein, 2005). It also shows that people often change their beliefs to match their actions, especially when those actions are repeated (Festinger, 1957).

So, "Practice becomes belief" can be understood within the model as: **Repeated mental states (S), especially those strongly activated by certain psychological patterns, can permanently change the system's basic Trait variables ($T_j$).**

## Key Terms

1.  **Cognitive Appraisal (C):** The main 'control signal' that turns an observation into an overall judgment, balancing what's happening now, how past moods linger, and your natural tendencies.
2.  **Valence(Ψ):** The initial positive or negative feeling the mind attaches to an observation before it's fully judged.
3.  **Personal Tendency (w):** A set of weights ($w_{\Psi}$, $w_{S}$) that show how much an individual is affected by new events compared to their previous mood.
4.  **Bias ($\text{Bias}_{M_1}$):** A basic, constant factor from your Prime Modality's core nature, representing a natural tendency towards optimism or pessimism.
5.  **Non-Reactive Observation:** A key practice in Classical Mindfulness where you observe your internal states without judgment, which weakens the connection between negative experiences and your resulting mental judgment.
6.  **Intentional Reframing:** A key practice in Quantum Mindfulness where you actively change your perception to find positive potential in any observation, leading to a positive mental outcome.
7.  **Trait ($T_j$):** A stable, long-term personality characteristic linked to a specific Psychodynamic Dimension.
8.  **Practice Becomes Belief:** The idea that repeated mental states, especially those driven by strong emotional or social experiences, can cause lasting changes to the basic Trait variables in the psychodynamic model.

## Summary

This chapter explained the Cognitive Appraisal (C) equation, the main way observations are turned into judgments. It's made up of three forces: the effect of the current event, the lingering influence of past moods, and a natural personality bias. The chapter then described how different mindfulness practices can interact with this equation. Classical Mindfulness is a passive, regulating practice that reduces reactivity by lowering the influence of current situations and emotions. In contrast, Quantum Mindfulness is an active, transformative practice that aims to create positive judgments by intentionally changing how observations are valued and, over time, shifting one's core bias. Finally, using case studies, the chapter showed that "practice becomes belief," illustrating how repeated emotional and social experiences can permanently change the model's long-term Traits ($T_j$), leading to new, steady belief systems.

## Review Questions

1.  What are the three distinct forces that are balanced in the Cognitive Appraisal (C) equation?
2.  How does the "Personal Tendency" weight $w_S$ influence an individual's daily experience?
3.  Explain the primary difference in goals between Classical (Passive) and Quantum (Active) Mindfulness in how they affect the C value.
4.  Using the model's terms, describe the three steps of the "active reframing" process.
5.  What is the mechanism by which "practice becomes belief" in the psychodynamic model? Provide an example.

## Answer Key

1.  The three forces are: The Impact of the Now ($w_{\Psi} \cdot \text{Valence}(\Psi)$), The Inertia of the Past ($w_{S} \cdot \text{AvgValence}(S_{t-1})$), and The Inherent Disposition ($\text{Bias}_{M_1}$).
2.  The $w_S$ weight determines how much a person's prior mood "sticks" or carries over. A person with a high $w_S$ will have moods with strong momentum (e.g., a bad morning ruins the day), while a person with a low $w_S$ will get over moods more quickly.
3.  Classical Mindfulness aims to **make the C value neutral**, moving it toward zero to reduce how much you react and prevent strong negative results. Quantum Mindfulness aims to **create a positive C value** by actively changing how you perceive things, even in difficult situations.
4.  The active reframing process involves: 1. Using **Psycho-Volitional ($P_{d1}$)** power to shift attention; 2. Engaging **Psycho-Meditative ($P_{d3}$)** processing to analyze the situation from a new perspective; and 3. Generating a novel insight via **Psycho-Conceptive ($P_{d2}$)** ideation.
5.  The way it works is that repeated mental states (**S**), often caused by strong social or emotional influences (like $P_{d4} or $P_{d9}$), can lead to lasting changes in the system's basic **Trait ($T_j$)** variables. For example, if you start a hobby for a partner, the repeated positive experiences driven by affection ($P_{d4}$) can change your underlying feeling for that hobby from negative to positive, making you genuinely enjoy it.
